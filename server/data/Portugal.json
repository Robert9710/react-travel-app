While the country's mild winters might not be scorching, they are quieter – and prices lower than usual, in a destination already beloved for being very affordable. Porto, Lisbon's little sister, has undergone its own creative renewal. Once-decaying medieval streets buzz with kerbside cafés and retooled townhouses, transformed into stylish hotels by local designers. The food scene is fizzing, there's more to Porto than sandwich shops and port wine tastings, from Michelin-starred menus to relaxed, wine-focused dining. And then there's the terraced port vineyards of the Douro Valley, 100km inland."

      "content": "If you're planning a trip to The City of Seven Hills, be prepared to return with aching muscles. Visiting in the spring is a wise decision – you'll avoid having to hike up hills in sweltering summer heat. In March, the temperatures are warm and the skies are blue, but it's far from overbearing. Opt for Lisbon to spend days exploring the glitzy interiors of the Palácio Nacional da Ajuda, gazing upwards in The Cathedral of Saint Mary Major, and strolling through the Botanical Gardens. But its the food that is most impressive here – work your way through our list of the very best restaurants in Lisbon."
