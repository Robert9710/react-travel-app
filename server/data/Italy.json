      "content": "While many skiers head straight for the French peaks between November and February, in-the-know winter sports fans and wellness enthusiasts go the extra mile and seek out the natural beauty of The Dolomites. It's a hiker's paradise during summer, but you'll need to don your skis and go off-piste for wild exploration over winter, thanks to considerable snowfall. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics and is ideal for skiers of all abilities, becoming Italy's answer to St Moritz in recent decades. However, these peaks hide various charming towns, and it's not all about the slopes. Check into one of the region's sleekest spa hotels to unwind completely after the Christmas chaos."

      "recommended": "February",
      "content": "February is carnival time in Venice, which makes it either the very best time to come, or the worst. Noblemen clink swords in St Mark's Square, courtesans cloaked in red silk drift down the Grand Canal on plumed gondolas, and gilded masks allow royalty to walk freely among the commoners. What seems like a Canaletto painting comes to life every year when revellers gather for three weeks of masked debauchery. Those seeking the quiet charms of the floating city will be disappointed, but if you dare to join the huddled masses you'll be rewarded with an otherworldly experience. You can flaunt your finery on the Rialto, dance the quadrilles at the Doge's ball and wake up the next morning in a luxurious four-poster bed in your very own Venetian palace wondering if it was all a dream."

      "recommended": "March",
      "content": "Rome is a city that caters to every type of traveller. History fanatics, hungry families, those in need of a good bottle of wine or art fiends – the Italian capital has it all. Eschewing the summer months is wise if you're looking to visit the city's main attractions, as you're likely to spend much of your time in long, never-ending queues or craning your neck at the back of impenetrable crowds. March is a much better shout – breezy spring weather makes for much more enjoyable trips to the sprawling Roman forum, Trevi Fountain and Colosseum, without the tourist hoards. Refuel at one of Rome's best restaurants – here are 42 of our favourites to check out on your spring holiday."

      "recommended": "January",
      "content": "If you’re seeking the warmest place in Italy in March, look to southeast Sicily. This eternally awe-inspiring island has Europe’s sunniest city in modern Catania and Europe’s hottest spot in ancient Syracuse. While there’s little chance of a heatwave in March, you’ll still get eight hours of sunshine a day, and the temperate Mediterranean spring climate is ideal for exploring the area’s baroque cities – Modica, Ragusa, Noto – and Greek and Roman remains. On warmer days, the dunes and lagoons of Vendicari Nature Reserve harbour some of the best (and quietest) beaches in all of Italy, along with a great diversity of birdlife returning from Africa in springtime."

      "title": "Sorrento",
      "recommended": "March",
      "content": "Nothing brings a spring to the step quite like the sight of Italy’s glorious Amalfi coast. Particularly in March, when its vertiginous twists are bathed in a daily average eight hours of sun. Cliffs plunge into the Tyrrhenian Sea, topped with grand palazzos and smart hotels. Narrow, Roman lanes are stuffed with limoncello stalls flogging the boozy spoils of Sorrento’s famous fruit. Its snoozy air and pastel-coloured houses are pure Italian cinema: you might even swear you’ve seen a young Sophia Loren looking impossibly saucy by the quay. Do as the Italians do and spend the lazy, romantic days enjoying a long aperitivo. Don’t miss fresh fritto misto at Marina Grande, the town’s old fishing harbour, or Michelin-starred Il Buco in the cellars of an old monastery, where chef Peppe Aversa serves seasonal ingredients under a stone-hewn, vaulted ceiling. The sweet life, indeed."
