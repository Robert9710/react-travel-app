      "content": "If a rave in sub-zero temperatures sounds appealing, Montréal is for you. The city's annual January Igloofest tempts parka-clad party people outside with a line-up of world-class EDM acts. Elsewhere, the French château architecture looks fabulous with frosting, and you can go snowshoeing up Mount Royal for excellent city views (it's more of a hill, really, right in the middle of town). Mile End's hipsters have been replaced by good-looking young families, but its food institutions remain: warm up with classic smoked-meat sandwiches at Schwartz's Deli, or St-Viateur's hot-out-the-oven, hand-rolled bagels (thinner and sweeter than New York's). For a comforting treat in the cold, poutine is considered a delicacy – try it at Au Pied de Cochon or Garnde Manger. If you need to come in from the cold, there's the Underground City - a network of shops, museums and restaurants below downtown's core."
