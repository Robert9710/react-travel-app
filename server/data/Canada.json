      "content": "If a rave in sub-zero temperatures sounds appealing, Montréal is for you. The city's annual January Igloofest tempts parka-clad party people outside with a line-up of world-class EDM acts. Elsewhere, the French château architecture looks fabulous with frosting, and you can go snowshoeing up Mount Royal for excellent city views (it's more of a hill, really, right in the middle of town). Mile End's hipsters have been replaced by good-looking young families, but its food institutions remain: warm up with classic smoked-meat sandwiches at Schwartz's Deli, or St-Viateur's hot-out-the-oven, hand-rolled bagels (thinner and sweeter than New York's). For a comforting treat in the cold, poutine is considered a delicacy – try it at Au Pied de Cochon or Garnde Manger. If you need to come in from the cold, there's the Underground City - a network of shops, museums and restaurants below downtown's core."

      "recommended": "March",
      "content": "The granddaddy of North American ski resorts does winter sports on a supersized scale. Up in the awe-inspiring Pacific Ranges above Vancouver, Whistler gets phenomenal snow in a winter season that runs November–May. The best month of all is March when you can expect bluebird powder days; it’s sunnier yet there’s still heavy snowfall, slopes and lifts are less busy, and rates are cheaper. In a resort that has committed to becoming carbon-neutral (including building a hydro plant to produce enough energy to power ski lifts, restaurants and snow cannons), there are a whole bunch of restaurants run with a sustainability ethos. Fine-dining Alta Bistro is perhaps the smartest of them, and the greenest: as well as all-seasonal, all-local ingredients, everything is ethically sourced, bought from nearby farms and makers, right down to the sustainably farmed wine. Plus, all organic waste gets composted at a local farm and they use renewable hydroelectric power."
