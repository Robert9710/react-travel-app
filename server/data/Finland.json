      "content": "February in Finnish Lapland might be bracing, but there’s plenty going on here that’s hot. How about hopping aboard the world’s only sauna gondola – a wooden cable car that treats passengers to a steamy ride over the slopes of Ylläs Ski Resort? Or working up a sweat by fat-biking across Ylläs National Park’s stark-white scenery (the thick treads help plucky cyclists pedal in deep snow). Of course, Christmas is high season here, but conditions are every bit as romantic in February, without the sky-high prices or crowds. Northern Lights stalkers also have a good chance of spotting those elusive, swirling illuminations – perhaps best viewed from the Aurora Domes at Harriniva, where igloo-like tents are fitted out with a transparent wall, wood burner and Champagne. Experiences with the Indigenous Sami people of Lapland are becoming ever more popular, but be sure your operator is providing a genuine connection with their culture (rather than a ‘show’). Done right, this kind of tourism helps boost a local economy that can only rely on a lucrative revenue stream – tourism – a few months of the year. Magnetic North Travel, for example, organises time with genuine reindeer herders and their families, so you get a real sense of their way of life."
