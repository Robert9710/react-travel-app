      "content": "Iceland is a pretty spectacular place to visit, and March is the perfect time to do so. You'll avoid the madding crowds of the summer travellers and miss the piercing cold of winter â€“ but you're still in for a decent chance of seeing the Aurora Borealis. Start in Reykjavik, where you can spend days hopping between the city's best restaurants and cosying up in candlelit bars before driving out to the wilderness to experience Iceland's lunar landscapes and volcanic beauty in all its glory."
