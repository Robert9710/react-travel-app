      "content": "350 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, this Norwegian city is a magical place to escape to in March. It's coming to the end of winter, so temperatures aren't as bitterly cold as the previous months, but travellers will still get the excitement of wrapping up in lots of layers and heading out to explore in the snow. Stroll through Tromsø to admire the generations-old wooden houses, each painted a different colour and stop by the Arctic Cathedral, an impressive architectural feat with a distinctive triangular shape and gorgeous stained-glass windows. You're still in with a good chance to spot the Northern Lights, too – head out on a tour to get away from any light pollution and wait with bated breath for the show to start."
